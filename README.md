## Resources: AWS Services Integration

* [Amazon S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/)
  * A primary bucket for storing collected weather data and economic indicators.
  * A secondary bucket to store processed data and results from Amazon Forecast.
  * An additional bucket for logging and storing miscellaneous project files.

* [Amazon Forecast](https://aws.amazon.com/forecast/)
  * Utilized for creating and training predictive models based on historical weather data.
  * Generating forecasts for rare weather events and analyzing their potential economic impacts.

* [Amazon Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) (x2)
  * A Lambda function for automating the data transformation process with Python, deployed with necessary memory and execution role.
  * Another Lambda function to periodically trigger Amazon Forecast operations and manage data flow.

* [Amazon EC2](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/)
  * An EC2 instance for conducting heavier data processing and analysis tasks.
  * Hosting the Jupyter Notebook server for detailed data exploration and visualization.

* [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/)
  * A DynamoDB table to store and manage the forecasts generated by Amazon Forecast for easy retrieval and analysis.

* [Amazon Identity and Access Management](https://aws.amazon.com/iam/)
  * IAM Roles with appropriate permissions for Lambda functions, Amazon Forecast, and EC2 instances to access other AWS resources securely.

* [AWS CloudFormation](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/)
  * Automating the deployment of the AWS infrastructure required for the project.
    
* [Amazon API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway/)
  * RESTful API endpoints to interact with web appplication
